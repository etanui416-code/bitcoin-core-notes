# Bitcoin Core Study Notes

This repository contains my public study notes on Bitcoin Core internals.
The goal is to understand existing design decisions, security assumptions,
and consensus rules before making open-source contributions.

## Focus Areas
- Transaction validation flow
- Mempool policy vs consensus rules
- Block validation and chain reorganizations
- Script evaluation basics
- Historical Bitcoin Core PR discussions

## Motivation
Bitcoin Core is consensus-critical software. I believe responsible
contributions start with deep study, careful review, and learning in public.

Notes are updated incrementally as I progress.
